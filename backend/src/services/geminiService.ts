DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING SCORES (1-5 Scale):
‚Ä¢ Eye Contact Level: ${data.eyeContact}/5
  (1=Rarely makes eye contact, 5=Excellent sustained eye contact)
  
‚Ä¢ Speech Development: ${data.speechLevel}/5
  (1=Non-verbal, 5=Age-appropriate speech)

CLINICAL TASK:
Based on this ${data.age}-year-old child's assessment scores, provide a comprehensive developmental evaluation with evidence-based therapy recommendations. Consider each score carefully - lower scores indicate greater concern.

YOU MUST RESPOND WITH VALID JSON IN THIS EXACT FORMAT:
{
  "assessment": "Write 2-3 professional sentences analyzing ${data.childName}'s overall developmental profile based on the specific scores provided",
  "riskLevel": "High" OR "Moderate" OR "Low",
  "focusAreas": [
    "First specific developmental area based on lowest scores",
    "Second specific developmental area",
    "Third specific developmental area"
  ],
  "therapyGoals": [
    "First SMART goal tailored to ${data.childName}'s age and needs",
    "Second SMART goal specific to the child's challenges",
    "Third SMART goal with measurable outcomes"
  ],
  "activities": [
    "First detailed activity with step-by-step instructions that parents can do at home - make it specific and actionable",
    "Second detailed activity with clear implementation steps and expected outcomes"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "First professional recommendation for next steps",
    "Second recommendation for professional support or resources"
  ]
}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. **assessment**: Analyze the ACTUAL scores provided (${data.eyeContact}, ${data.speechLevel}, ${data.socialResponse}, ${data.sensoryReactions}). Mention specific concerns.

2. **riskLevel**: 
   - "High" if average score ‚â§ 2.5 (significant delays, immediate intervention needed)
   - "Moderate" if average score 2.5-3.5 (some concerns, targeted therapy recommended)
   - "Low" if average score > 3.5 (typical development, enrichment suggested)

3. **focusAreas**: Based on the LOWEST scores, identify specific areas like:
   - If eyeContact ‚â§ 3: "Joint Attention and Visual Engagement Skills"
   - If speechLevel ‚â§ 3: "Expressive and Receptive Language Development"
   - If socialResponse ‚â§ 3: "Social Communication and Peer Interaction"
   - If sensoryReactions ‚â§ 3: "Sensory Processing and Integration"

4. **therapyGoals**: Create SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) appropriate for ${data.age}-year-old

5. **activities**: Provide DETAILED activities with:
   - Clear step-by-step instructions
   - Materials needed
   - Duration and frequency
   - What success looks like

6. Use evidence-based practices: ABA, DIR/Floortime, TEACCH, PECS, social stories
7. Use warm, hopeful, professional language
8. Consider child's age (${data.age} years) in all recommendations
